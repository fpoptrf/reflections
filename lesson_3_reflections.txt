When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I want to use a remote repository, when I have finished work. Because I want to keep
    the code safty. My local environment may broken in future.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pull send us cold copy of the repository. This is good for making some changes
    to the code. If someone updates remote repository, automatic pull will lead to
    conflict to the code we have edited. We don't want that situation.
