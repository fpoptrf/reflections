What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When I initialize a repository, .git directory is created to keep tracking changes and
    save snapshot for each commit. Initializing repository is required to select which files
    to be managed by version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is in between the working directory and the repository. It offers
    functionality to select files to be included in a commit.
