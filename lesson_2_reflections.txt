What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When I initialize a repository, .git directory is created to keep tracking changes and
    save snapshot for each commit. Initializing repository is required to select which files
    to be managed by version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is in between the working directory and the repository. It offers
    functionality to select files to be included in a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    We can use staging area to sepalate multiple logical change to single logical change.
    This functionality helps us to follow the rule "one commit per logical change".

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

    It is helpful if we maintain multiple codes for released product and developing.
    We may use main branch for fixing bugs of released product, and develop branch for
    adding some new features to developing version.
